## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to combine two of my interests in one project. I love both music and coding. I used concepts from computer science (like loops and modular programming) and concepts from music theory( like time signature, rhythm, melody and chords).

## Youtube
Uploaded the result on youtube. Added vocals-only track on top of music generated from code.

## Computer Science Concepts

### Modular Programming
Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. Every instrument in the composition is a different module and runs independantly. However when every instance is combined the whole track comes together. 

Furthermore the track can be modularized in another way. Chorus and verses. On final chorus, all the modules come together (piano, harmony and drums).

### Loops
Loops are a programming element that repeat a portion of code a set number of times until the desired process is complete. This concept is used to repeat the melody modules of either verse or chorus.

## Music Theory Concepts
### Time signature
The time signature is a notational convention used in musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. I used this concept to calculate the bars which each instrument starts and finishes in order to be used in the loop's condition. 

### Rhythm
Rhythm is music's pattern in time. I used this concept to calculate the tempo in each bar and how much time each instrument had to wait. 

### Melody
A melody, also tune, voice or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity.

### Chords
A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of pitches/frequencies consisting of multiple notes that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. This concept is important so that I didn't had to code each note individually.
